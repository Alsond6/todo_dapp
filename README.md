# Todo List DApp
This is a simple to-do list decentralized application (DApp) developed on the Ethereum blockchain using the Solidity programming language. The DApp allows users to create to-do items with a title, description, due date, and priority level (low, medium, high). Users can mark their to-do items as completed and delete them.

## Getting Started
To use this DApp, you will need to install the MetaMask browser extension and set up a wallet on the Ethereum mainnet or a testnet. Once you have a wallet, you can interact with the DApp by visiting its deployed address on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Usage
The DApp has the following functionalities:

## Create a To-Do Item
To create a new to-do item, click on the "Create New Item" button and fill in the required details: title, description, due date, and priority level. Click on the "Create" button to create the item.

## Mark a To-Do Item as Completed
To mark a to-do item as completed, click on the "Mark as Completed" button next to the item.

## Delete a To-Do Item
To delete a to-do item, click on the "Delete" button next to the item.

## View To-Do Items
To view your to-do items, click on the "View List" button. This will display a list of all your to-do items along with their details: title, description, due date, priority level, and completion status.
